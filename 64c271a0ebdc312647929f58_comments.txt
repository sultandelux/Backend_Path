Your CliftonStrengths results indicate that you possess a diverse range of strengths. Your top five strengths are Focus, Ideation, Restorative, Analytical, and Strategic. These strengths suggest that you have a natural ability to concentrate on tasks, generate innovative ideas, solve problems, think critically, and plan strategically.

However, it is important to be aware of your blind spots as well. As an INTJ, you may sometimes struggle with being too focused on the big picture and neglecting important details. It is crucial to pay attention to the finer points and ensure that your plans are well-executed. Additionally, your introverted nature may sometimes make it challenging for you to collaborate effectively in team settings. It is important to find a balance between working independently and collaborating with others to leverage the strengths of both approaches.
